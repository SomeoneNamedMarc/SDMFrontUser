            <p>We are a group of computer science students developing a System Method Development Calculator. This tool helps users find the most suitable method based on their input. The project is a work in progress, and weâ€™re actively improving its features and performance. The system is built using React for the user frontend, ASP.NET for the API, and WPF for the admin frontend. Our goal is to create an efficient and user-friendly solution while expanding our knowledge and skills throughout the development process</p>
